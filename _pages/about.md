I am an associate professor in Computer Science at the University of Udine studying computer vision and machine (deep) learning.

Previously, I was an assistant professor (under tenure), and also spent a year as a visiting research scientist at the Video Computing Group at the University of California Riverside, under the guidance of Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury. 

I did my postdoctoral studies with Gian Luca Foresti at the Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics at the University of Udine. I completed my Ph.D.(s) in Multimedia Communication with a major in Computer Vision with Christian Micheloni, and in Information Engineering with a major in hierarchical learning architectures under the supervision of Gian Luca Foresti.
